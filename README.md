Hello everyone,

This is a dummy project created as part of a training exercise by Tanmay Deshpande and Sejal Ahire.
The project is given by Ms. Neha Rungta, our L1 manager. 

The project in itself is fairly straightforward. We have to create a dynamic website using Angular, springboot and MySQL
to show simple changes and data storage capabilities. 

Thank you.
